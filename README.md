This project is an interactive crowdfunding product sign up page built with no external libraries. The user is able to select a reward type or simply back the project. After making a selection, a modal appears that then allows the user to specify a donation amount. After making a donation, the total amount raised, the number of backers, the number of reward items, and the progress bar are updated accordingly.

The application includes a custom built mobile menu button, a dynamic progress bar, and custom radio buttons among other features.
